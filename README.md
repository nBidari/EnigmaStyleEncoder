# EnigmaStyleEncoder

This is an Enigma-Esque Encoder that I decided to make as a first prototype for a mobile app. This will later be altered for Java and then eventually some form of mobile developer.

It's written in Python3 and uses tkinter. The UI is not permanent or even part of a larger idea, it's just to use it easily. The logic is the important part.

It doesn't have the plugboard, yet.
